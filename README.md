# Task3

## The use of object recognition technology to identify the objects that the robot can meet by using Teachable Machine

##### I used the Teachable Machine technology from Google, and then the image recognition model, and I used pictures of fruits (bananas, oranges, strawberries) and then taught them to the machine, and then I made a machine test to make sure of that
###### Now I will show the steps and pictures to do that:




##### 1- First, enter the machine learning from Google, then create a new project using the image project:





##### 2- After that, I renewed how many classes I wanted. I chose three classes, a class for orange, a class for bananas, and a class for strawberries, and uploaded pictures of the three fruits from the image file:






##### 3- Third, I pressed the "Training" button to train the three classes to the machine:





##### 4- Then, I uploaded a picture of the orange fruit, different from the pictures that I uploaded of the orange class, to test the training of the machine. Was it done correctly or not? 




###### The result is clear in the picture, the training is successful



##### 5- Finally, I uploaded a picture of strawberry and banana fruit to verify whether the machine will be able to distinguish the two fruits together or not ?



###### The result is not very good and accurate, but we can say that she was able to distinguish that





### Next, I exported the training code using two programming languages, Java and Python
